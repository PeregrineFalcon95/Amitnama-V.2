    <meta name="Description" content="Author: Amit Sarker. This section is created for newcomers in Compititive programming (Programming Contest). Here we will discuss the most essential topics that every programmers should know. We will also solve programming problems with those topics. In this tutorial series we will discuss problems like- Array Manipulation , Ad-Hoc, Implementation and many more topics. All of them are designed for beginners. We will discuss many usefull techniques through problem solving. But readers are adviced to try to solve it by themselves before moving to solution part. If you can solve it by yourself, you are encouraged to see the solution part. Maybe you will learn some new techniques. The total series is divied into seperate parts. As you will move forward the complexity of the problems will be risen. ">
